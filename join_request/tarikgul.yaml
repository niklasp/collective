about: "I am a Software Engineer, mountaineer, long distance hiker, and soon to
  be father. Professionally, I build tools for the polkadot ecosystem. My own
  passions include cryptography, computational geometry, and all things TS +
  Rust."
motivation: My motivation to join the tooling collective is to bring positive 
  impact to aspects of the decentralization of polkadot, and help make other developer experiences better.
  I have almost 4 years of experience in this ecosystem, and have built and maintained critical tools
  such as Substrate-api-sidecar, txwrapper-core, asset-transfer-api, Polkadot-JS, and many more.
